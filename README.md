### Hi there, I'm Jael 👋


I'm interested in Web Develepment. 
I am an autodidact and I would like to solve my own questions.
Firstly, I started to watch videos on YouTube Platform, and I'm still doing today.

I'd like to have My Startup, for this reason I named it Puerto22 in this repo.
I hope to help the community.
