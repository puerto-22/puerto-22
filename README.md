### Hi there, I'm Jael ðŸ‘‹


I'm interested in Web Develepment. 
I am an autodidact and I would like to solve my own questions.
Firstly, I started to watch videos on YouTube Platform, and I'm still doing today.

I'd like to have My Startup, for this reason I named it REDLA in this repo.
I hope to help the community.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal projects because I'm just learning yet.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript for Backend and Frontend.

You can find me:

  - morita.dev

Note:
  I'm in love with Computer Networking and Languages!!!
